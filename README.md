# DeblurGAN
[arXiv Paper Version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07064.pdf)

Pytorch implementation of the paper DeblurGAN: Blind Motion Deblurring Using Conditional Adversarial Networks.

Our network takes blurry image as an input and procude the corresponding sharp estimate, as in the example:
<img src="images/animation3.gif" width="400px"/> <img src="images/animation4.gif" width="400px"/>


The model we use is Conditional Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty + Perceptual loss based on VGG-19 activations. Such architecture also gives good results on other image-to-image translation problems (super resolution, colorization, inpainting, dehazing etc.)

## How to run

### Prerequisites
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN (CPU untested, feedback appreciated)
- Pytorch

Download weights from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5r6cy0x72s8x9yf/latest_net_G.pth?dl=0) . Note that during the inference you need to keep only Generator weights.

Put the weights into 
```bash
/.checkpoints/experiment_name
```
To test a model put your blurry images into a folder and run:
```bash
python test.py --dataroot /.path_to_your_data --model test --dataset_mode single --learn_residual
```
## Data
Download dataset for Object Detection benchmark from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPMBmRj-jBDO2ax4CxkBs9iczIFrs8VA/view?usp=sharing)

## Train

If you want to train the model on your data run the following command to create image pairs:
```bash
python datasets/combine_A_and_B.py --fold_A /path/to/data/A --fold_B /path/to/data/B --fold_AB /path/to/data
```
And then the following command to train the model

```bash
python train.py --dataroot /.path_to_your_data --learn_residual --resize_or_crop crop --fineSize CROP_SIZE (we used 256)
```
